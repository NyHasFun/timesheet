Nyasha's timesheet

This application is a web based time clock for tracking the number of hours I spent at work. It will use input from the webpage or Amazon IoT button to track clock-in and clock out timestamps. I will also be able to indicate how productive I was using a 5 star rating scale.

There will be view to edit the timestamps (In case I forget to clock-in or clock-out).
There will also be list of all of my shifts worked. Hopefully I will be able to gain some insight from the data (i.e. What day of the week do I spend the most/least amount of time and work, what day of the week I am the most productive, am I more productive if I come in earlier, or if I work later)
The best part is there will also be a countdown till the end the workday!!
